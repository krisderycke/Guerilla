# Guerilla
## Site
The site i am forced to enhance is : http://www.kaiseki-antwerpen.be/  
Its an ugly and way too "crowded" site.  

## Start
I started gathering the core information of the site, saving it on my local.  

## Enhancement process
At first i used a template found on this [site](https://html5up.net/), but I quickly deleted it, since i wasn't able to modify this template to my wishes.   
So then I started building the website from scratch, using only a little bit of Bootstrap's Frameworks.   

## Result
I am proud (ish) to present the new website for this restaurant. i think it is very lean and it looks more attractive.   
The new site can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/krisderycke) (repo:Guerilla) or via this link: https://krisderycke.github.io/Guerilla/
